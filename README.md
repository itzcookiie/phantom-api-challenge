## I chose to build my APIs around anime, since I love watching anime and thought it would be cool to create an API around it

## API

### GET /anime

Returns a list of the 10 most popular anime.

### GET /anime/{character_name}

Returns a list of anime programmes based on the name of the character.
E.g. for the anime **Naruto**, if you made the request /anime/**sasuke** with sasuke being the character name,
you will get a list of anime that have the character sasuke
